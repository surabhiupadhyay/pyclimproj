# pyclimproj

**pyclimproj** is a Python package and GUI-based tool for downloading and exploring CMIP6-based hydroclimatic projection data hosted on the [ORNL HydroSource SWA9505V3 portal](https://hydrosource2.ornl.gov/files/SWA9505V3/).  
It enables researchers and practitioners to selectively download NetCDF files based on model, scenario, variable, and time range, and to preview and inspect downloaded datasets.
