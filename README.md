# pyclimproj

**pyclimproj** is a Python package for downloading, pre-processing, and visualizing CMIP6-based hydroclimatic projection data hosted on the [ORNL HydroSource SWA9505V3 portal](https://hydrosource2.ornl.gov/files/SWA9505V3/).  

The SWA9505V3 archive contains CMIP6-based hydrologic projections (e.g., precipitation, temperature, snowpack, runoff) bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated to CONUS scales. This package simplifies the process of recursively browsing directories, filtering relevant NetCDF files by variable or scenario, and downloading them locally for further scientific analysis.
